## 🧠 Projects

### 📌 1. Generative AI Chatbot (2024)
🔹 Overview:
- This project was designed to create an intelligent chatbot that can read user-uploaded documents and answer questions based on their content. The goal was to reduce the time spent manually reading through documents by allowing users to query them naturally — like talking to an AI assistant.

🔹 How It Works:
- The user uploads a PDF document.
- The backend parses the file and extracts text using libraries like pdfplumber and docx.
- When a user asks a question, the relevant document content and the query are sent to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo.
- The model responds with an accurate, context-aware answer based on the uploaded document.

🔹 Technologies Used:
-Frontend: Streamlit (for file upload and chat interface)
- Backend: Python
- AI Model: GPT-3.5-Turbo via OpenAI API
- File Parsing: pdfplumber
- Prompt Engineering: Dynamic context window with token management
- Embedding + Search (optional): FAISS or HuggingFace embeddings

🔹 Outcome:
- Created a functional prototype that mimics real-world use cases like document summarization, compliance document analysis, and contract Q&A.
- Helped build a strong understanding of prompt engineering and OpenAI’s token limits.

### 📈 2. Stock Market Prediction using LSTM (2025)
🔹 Overview:
- This project aimed to forecast stock market trends using historical price data and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks — a type of deep learning model known for time-series prediction.

🔹 How It Works:
- Historical stock data is fetched using the yfinance library.
- Data is preprocessed and normalized for better model performance.
- An LSTM model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras to learn the sequential pattern in stock prices.
- The model makes predictions on future stock prices.
- A Streamlit interface allows users to choose a stock and view predicted vs. actual prices graphically.

🔹 Technologies Used:
- Machine Learning: LSTM, TensorFlow, Keras
- Data Collection: yfinance
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Frontend: Streamlit (interactive prediction dashboard)

🔹 Outcome:
- Successfully predicted stock price trends with visualization.
- Gained practical experience with time-series forecasting, deep learning workflows, and Python-based deployment.
